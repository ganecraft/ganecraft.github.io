Generally one bonus is positive and the other is negative but it's possible for both to be positive when the bonus amount is low. The maximum is 75% (very low chance) and neither bonus can be 0%, both are always added/rolled. The bonus CAN NOT be transfered to other weapons, however, enchants from other weapons can still be transfered to the current one via greenbooks. When adding hitbonus to the weapon one of the bonuses is rolled to be the positive one and the other will be the amount of the positive one negated, halved and a few % randomly added or subtracted. Applying . To add hitbonus you'll need a bonus adder, a trim template of any kind and the weapon you want to apply it to. The procedure can only be done inside of a smithing table. The bonus values are applied after the smithing is completed. This is completely random and exact values can not be known beforehand. If you didn't get the desired results you can always reroll the bonuses. There's no limit on how many times a certain item's hitbonus can be rerolled, but there is a time limit of 2 seconds between each roll. After the bonuses are added/rerolled it can not be reversed. Bonus adders . There's 3 different bonus adders: . | | | . | Randomly chooses each time if the mob or pvp damage will be positive. | Always makes the mob bonus positive. | Always makes the pvp bonus positive. | . | This is the most common adder from mob drops and can't be bought. | Can be bought at __ NPC. | Can be bought at __ NPC. | .

The amount of netherite required is much higher and it's difficult to mine in the nether, since the blast resistance of common nether blocks have been increased. However, netherite (debris, scrap and sometimes ingots) can be obtained from mob drops and from boss or event chests. This results in netherite gear being more rare and makes netherite a sought after crafting material. Netherite upgrade . The gear upgrade process has been changed so netherite upgrade smithing templates have to be crafted and can not be found in bastion chests anymore. Making one requires netherite and diamond blocks and also a trim template other than the upgrade template. The upgrade smithing templates can not be doubled, it always requires an additional trim template to create one. Blast resistance of blocks in the nether is increased, and beds don't explode. With this change mining netherite via explosions is very tedious and probably isn't worth it with TNT. Loot . Other than pick mining in the nether for ancient debris netherite can be obtained from the following: . Containers . | Wooden box, Wither lootbag, Upgraded halloween chest . | .

Player HP does not regenerate when the player is poisoned. Berrybushes don't damage players if they sneak through them. Mobs only drop loot if killed by players. Mined blocks don't have pickup delay and can only be picked up by the miner for 10 seconds. Mined block xp goes immediately to the player, does not produce orbs. Enchant . Oldschool enchant system - level 30 enchant takes 30 levels. Oldschool enchant system - enchants can't be previewed (always shows channeling IX). Greenbook system. Crafting . Enchanted golden apples can be crafted. Colored terracotta can be crafted back into plain terracotta. Netherite ingots can be crafted back into 4 netherite scraps (no gold). Random stuff . Sheep don't drop wool when killed, only when sheared. Fortune on shears and the luck status effect affects the amount of wool sheeps drop when sheared. Fires go out much quicker. Farmland can't be trampled. Mobs can't modify blocks except: villagers, sheep, rabbit and silverfish. End crystal, lightning and nether bed explosions don't ignite blocks. Block and mob explosions don't destroy blocks (TNT does). Villagers regen HP after sleeping or restocking their trades. Bees regenerate a little when leaving the hive. Bees regrow stingers instead of dying. Bees don't get damaged by water, only if drowning. When a player quits he's demounted from any mob or boat.
